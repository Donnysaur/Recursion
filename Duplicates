/*Write a C++ program to find the frequency of each element in a sorted array containing duplicates using recursion
 The user must input the size of the Array and what is inside the array
 Sample Output: If the array given is: int arr[]= {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5,};
1 appears 1 time(s)
2 appears 2 time(s)
3 appears 1 time(s)
4 appears 3 time(s)
5 appears 2 time(s)
